I am a MSCS student at Emory university, supervised by [Prof. Li Xiong](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~lxiong/).
 
Previously, I finished my undergraduate study at CUHK-Shenzhen. I am very lucky to be supervised by [Prof. Yixiang Fang](https://fangyixiang.github.io/) and [Prof. Chenhao Ma](https://chenhao-ma.github.io/) in there.

I am interested in LLM, data privacy and data mining.
